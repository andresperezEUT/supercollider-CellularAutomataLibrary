CellularAutomataLibrary
=====================================

SuperCollider class library for 1D and 2D cellular automata simulation and sonification

Features:
- Great variety of 1D and 2D cellular automata families
- Methods for 1D rule space characterization
- Unlimited simultaneous cellular automata
- Several sonification methods implemented: additive synthesis, substractive, granular...
- Possibility of creating own sonification methods
- Unlimited possibilities of parameter relationship from different cellular automata

=====================================
NOTE: some GUI elements are broken at the moment (swingOSC). I will fix them to the new Qt system when I find some time..
thanks!
